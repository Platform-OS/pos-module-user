# User Module

This module serves as a starting point for adding authentication and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to your application. Before using the module for the first time, we recommend reading the official platformOS documentation on [User Authentication Basics](https://documentation.platformos.com/get-started/build-your-first-app/user-authentication) and on [Example Application](#example-application).

This module follows the [platformOS DevKit best practices](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules) and includes the [core module](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-core) as a dependency, enabling you to implement patterns such as [Commands](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-core?tab=readme-ov-file#commands--business-logic) and [Events](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-core?tab=readme-ov-file#events).

For more information, 
- read the documentation about the [built-in User table](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/user),
- learn about [how platformOS manages sessions](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/session),
- and gain a high-level overview of [authentication strategies in platformOS](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/authentication).

## Installation

The platformOS User Module is available on the [Partner Portal Modules Marketplace](https://partners.platformos.com/marketplace/pos_modules/139).

### Prerequisites

Before installing the module, please ensure you have [pos-cli](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/pos-cli#overview) installed. This tool is essential for managing and deploying platformOS projects.

The platformOS User Module is fully compatible with [platformOS Check](https://github.com/Platform-OS/platformos-lsp#platformos-check----a-linter-for-platformos), a linter and language server that supports any IDE with Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration. For Visual Studio Code users, you can enhance your development experience by installing the [VSCode platformOS Check Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformOS.platformos-check-vscode).

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to your project directory** where you want to install the User Module.

2. **Run the installation command**:

```bash
   pos-cli modules install user
   pos-cli modules download user
```

This command installs the User Module along with its dependencies (such as [pos-module-core](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-core) and [pos-module-common-styling](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-common-styling) and updates or creates the `app/pos-modules.json` file in your project directory to track module configurations.

### Setup

1.  **Install the module** using the [pos-cli](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-cli).

2. Configure the [common-styling](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-common-styling) to include default styles. It is recommended that you familiarize with the common-styling module by reading its README file. At ensures that your [Layout](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/layouts) includes:

a) `pos-app` class in the root `html` tag
b) css files from the common-styling module in the head section
c) js code to create a global `pos` namespace in the head section
d) liquid code which displays built-in notifications after `{{ content_for_layout }}` in the body section

Navigate to [app/views/layouts/application.liquid](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-user/blob/master/app/views/layouts/application.liquid) to see a complete example of a layout file with the common-styling and user module stylesheets and js code included. 

3. (Optional) Create a [migration](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/directory-structure#migrations) to set up the `USER_DEFAULT_ROLE` [constant](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-objects#context-constants).

To generate a new migration, can use `pos-cli migrations generate` command. Remember to change `env` to your environment that you've used for the `pos-cli env add` command. If you don't remember it, check the `.pos` file.

```
  pos-cli migrations generate <env> setup_user_default_role
```

Add the following line of code to the newly created migration file to set the default role to `member`:

```
{% liquid
  function result = 'modules/core/commands/variable/set', name: 'USER_DEFAULT_ROLE', value: 'member'
  log result, type: 'setup_user_default_role result'
%}
```

Donâ€™t forget to deploy your code to invoke the newly created migration:

```
pos-cli deploy <env>
```

4. Overwrite default views that you would like to customize by following the guide on [overwriting a module file](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/modules#overwritting-a-module-file). This allows you to add functionality based on your project requirements, such as extending the registration form with additional fields. At a minimum, you should overwrite the [permissions file](modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid), where you will configure [RBAC authorization](#rbac-authorization) roles and permissions for your application:


```
mkdir -p app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions
cp modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid
```

5. Create a [superadmin](#superadmin) using the [GraphQL Explorer](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pos-cli/developing-graphql-queries-using-pos-cli-gui).

* To create a new user, use the [user_create](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/graphql/data/mutations/user-create) mutation. The query to create a user with the email `admin@example.com` and password `password` would look as follows:

```
mutation user_create {
  user: user_create(user: { 
    email: "admin@example.com", 
    password: "password"
  }) {
      id
      email
    }
  }
```

### Managing Module Files

The default behavior of modules is that **the files are never deleted**. It is assumed that developers might not have access to all of the files, and thanks to this feature, they can still overwrite some of the module's files without breaking them. Since the User Module is fully public, it is recommended to delete files on deployment. To do this, ensure your `app/config.yml` includes the User Module and its dependencies in the list `modules_that_allow_delete_on_deploy`:

``` yaml
modules_that_allow_delete_on_deploy:
- core
- user
```

## Example application

We recommend creating a [new Instance](https://partners.platformos.com/instances/new) and deploying this module as an application to get a better understanding of the basics and the functionality this module provides. When you install the module using `pos-cli modules install user`, only the contents of the `modules/user` will be available in your project. The `app` directory serves as an example of how you could incorporate the User Module into your application. When analyzing the code in the `app` directory, pay attention to the following files:

* **`app/config.yml`** and **`app/user.yml`**: These files are defined according to the [Setup](#setup) instructions.
* **`app/views/page/index.liquid`**: Implements the example application homepage, displaying information about the currently logged-in user if available, or providing links for registration, sign-in, and password reset functionality for unauthenticated users.
* **`app/views/pages/admin/index.liquid`**: Implements the `/admin` page, demonstrating permission-checking functionality.
* **`app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid`**: Demonstrates how to configure permissions in your application by [overwriting a module file](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/modules#overwriting-a-module-file).

## Functionality provided by the user module:

Once the module is installed and you have completed the [setup](#setup), you will immediately gain access to the new endpoints created by this module. For example, you can navigate to `/users/new` for the registration form or `/sessions/new` for the login form. This section describes all the functionalities provided by this module and includes a roadmap for potential future enhancements.

To provide your own HTML (for example, for styling purposes), you can leverage the fact that all of the endpoints use the [theme_render_rc](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#theme-render-rc) Liquid tag. This means you can easily provide your own HTML for each endpoint by creating a partial in the `app` directory. For example, you can create `app/views/partials/users/new.liquid` for the registration endpoint. Refer to the Endpoints section for each functionality to see which partial to create for which endpoint.

### Registration

The **User module** is fully functional and requires no modifications to implement a basic registration process. This module provides essential **CRUD operations** for the built-in **[User object](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/user)** in platformOS, enabling you to manage users.

With these CRUD commands, you can handle typical user management operations such as registering new users, updating user information, and managing user data through platformOSâ€™s API.

#### Endpoints for the registration

The table below outlines the [resourceful routes](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules#resourceful-route-naming-convention) provided for registration functionality:

| HTTP method   | slug  | page file path |  description | partial rendering HTML |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | /users/new | `modules/user/public/views/pages/users/new.liquid` | Renders a registration form with inputs for email and password. | app/views/users/new.liquid |
| POST  | /users | `modules/user/public/views/pages/users/create.liquid` | Adds a new [User](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/user) to the database and logs the user in or re-renders the form if validation errors occur. You can modify the redirect path using the `redirect_to` param or by setting `return_to` [Session field](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#session). | app/views/users/new.liquid |

#### CRUD commands 

The User module provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users in platformOS. You can run commands such as creating or deleting users.

The User module provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users in platformOS. You can run commands such as creating or deleting users.

You can create:

```
function result = 'modules/user/commands/user/create', email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password', roles: []
```

load:

```
function user = 'modules/user/queries/user/load', id: '1'
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Usually, you will want to load the currently authenticated user. You can achieve this by providing [context.current_user.id](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-objects#context-current_user) as the ID:


update:

```
function user = 'modules/user/queries/user/update', id: '1', email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password'
```

and delete:

```
function result = 'modules/user/commands/user/delete', id: '1'
```

#### Assigning roles to users during registration

The `POST /users` endpoint defined in `modules/user/public/views/pages/users/create.liquid` assigns the default role specified by the constant `DEFAULT_USER_ROLE`â€”see [Setup](#setup) for more information.

### Session-Based Authentication

#### Endpoints for Sign In / Sign Out

The following table outlines the [resourceful routes](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules#resourceful-route-naming-convention) for sign-in and sign-out functionality:

| HTTP method   | slug  | page file path |  description | partial rendering HTML |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | /sessions/new | `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/new.liquid` | Renders a sign-in form with inputs for user's email and password. | app/views/partials/sessions/new.liquid |
| POST  | /sessions | `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/create.liquid` | Creates a session for the authenticated user based on [password authentication](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/authentication#password) or re-renders the sign in form if credentials do not match. You can modify the redirect path with a param called `redirect_to` or by setting `return_to` [Session field](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#session). | app/views/partials/sessions/new.liquid |
| DELETE  | /sessions | Â `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/delete.liquid` | Invalidates the current session and logging the user out. | N/A |

Example: You can define a `hook_user_login` that redirects a user to `/admin` if they have the `admin_pages.view` permission. 

```
assign redirect_to = '/'
function can = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: params.user, do: 'admin_pages.view'
if can
  assign redirect_to = '/admin'
endif

assign res = '{}' | parse_json | hash_merge: redirect_to: redirect_to
return res
```

#### Log in using email and password

You can log the user in (which [creates a new session](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/session#security)) using the following command:

```
function res = 'modules/user/commands/session/create', email: 'email@example.com', password: 'password'
```

This command also triggers the `hook_user_login` hooks.

#### Accessing current profile

To access information about the currently logged-in user, use the following command provided by the module:

```
function profile = 'modules/user/helpers/current_profile'
```

This command is implemented in `modules/user/public/lib/helpers/current_profile.liquid`. When you investigate the file, you'll notice that it not only loads the user's profile information from the database but also extends the profile's roles with either [authenticated](#authenticated-role) or [anonymous](#anonymous-role) if the user is not currently logged in. User object is also available under profile.user when the user is logged in.

#### Log out

To log out a user and destroy their session, run the following command:

```
function res = 'modules/user/commands/session/destroy'
```

This command triggers the `hook_user_logout` hooks.

#### Log in without password validation 

Itâ€™s possible to skip password validation and create a session while triggering the `hook_user_login` by setting the `validate_password` boolean argument to `false` when calling the `modules/user/commands/session/create` command. In this case, the `user_id` argument must be provided.

```
function res = 'modules/user/commands/session/create', user_id: '1', validate_password: false
```

### Reset password

The reset password functionality consists of two resources: `password` and `authentication_link`. 

#### Endpoints for Reset Password

The table below contains the [resourceful routes](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules#resourceful-route-naming-convention) provided for the reset password functionality, ordered based on the flow. The process begins with `GET /passwords/reset` and ends at `POST /passwords/create`, which updates the password and redirects the user to the sign-in page.

| HTTP method   | slug  | page file path |  description | partial rendering HTML |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | /passwords/reset | `modules/user/public/views/pages/passwords/reset.liquid` | Renders a reset password form. | app/views/partials/passwords/reset.liquid |
| POST  | /authentication_links | `modules/user/public/views/pages/authentication_links/create.liquid` | Generates a link with [temporary token](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/authentication#temporary-token) and sends an email using the `modules/user/commands/emails/auth-link` command to the email address provided by the user in the reset password step.  | app/views/partials/passwords/reset.liquid |
| GET  | /passwords/new | `modules/user/public/views/pages/passwords/new.liquid` | This endpoint [authenticates the user using the temporary token](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/authentication#temporary-token) using `modules/user/helpers/user_from_temporary_token` helper and, if successful, it renders a form where the user can provide their new password. | app/views/partials/passwords/new.liquid | 
| POST  | /passwords/create | `modules/user/public/views/pages/passwords/create.liquid` | Overwrites the existing user's password with the new password and redirects the user to the `GET /sessions/new` endpoint, so they can log in. | app/views/partials/passwords/new.liquid |

#### CRUD commands 

To create or update a given user's password:

```
function result = 'modules/user/commands/passwords/create', object: object
```

To create an `authentication link` that points to the `GET /passwords/edit` endpoint, which will be sent to the user's email, use the following command. The authentication link will include [a temporary token that authenticates a user based on their email only](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/authentication#temporary-token):

```
function object = 'modules/user/commands/authentication_links/create', email: "john@doe.com", host: context.location.host
```

### RBAC Authorization

The module provides the foundation for implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in your platformOS application. As described in the registration section, all users initially receive the role defined by the `DEFAULT_USER_ROLE` [constant](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-objects#context-constants).

#### Built-in roles

There are three built-in roles that are provided out of the box by the module:

##### Anonymous Role

This role is artificially granted in `modules/user/public/lib/queries/user/current.liquid`. It represents an anonymous user, for which you might want to still want to check some permission. For example, only anonymous users should be able to sign in or register into the system. This is why you will see built-in permissions in `modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid` for `users.register` and `sessions.create`, which are checked in [Endpoints for Sign-In](#endpoints-for-sign-in-sign-out) and [Endpoints for the registration](#endpoints-for-the-registration).

A typical use case for the anonymous user role is on an eCommerce website, where anonymous users can purchase items without registering.

##### Authenticated Role

This role is artificially granted in `modules/user/public/lib/queries/user/current.liquid`.It represents an authenticated user. The typical use case for this role is to restrict access to certain areas for anonymous users, without assigning a specific role to the user yet. For example, authenticated users might access free content, but to access paid content, they would need to subscribe, after which the system would grant them an additional role like `member` or `subscriber` with extra permissions.

##### Superadmin

Any user with the `superadmin` role will have immediate access to any permission checked in the [Authorization Commands](#authorization-commands).

#### Role management commands

The roles are stored in [User's property](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/users/user#adding-properties-to-the-user) named `roles`. 

You can append role using the `append` command:

```
function result = 'modules/user/commands/user/roles/append', id: 1, role: "admin"
```

You can remove role using the `remove` command:

```
function result = 'modules/user/commands/user/roles/remove', id: 1, role: "admin"
```

You can set multiple roles at once using the `set` command:

```
assign roles = '["member", "admin"]' | parse_json
function result = 'modules/user/commands/user/roles/set', id: 1, roles: roles
```

#### Role management queries

You can fetch all defined roles in the system by using `modules/user/queries/roles/all` query:

```
function roles = 'modules/user/queries/roles/all'
```

You can fetch all custom roles (without `authenticated` and `anonymous`) defined in the system by using `modules/user/queries/roles/custom` query:

```
function roles = 'modules/user/queries/roles/custom'
```

#### Authorization Commands 

The module offers several helper commands to authorize users:

##### `can_do` command

This command returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user has permission to perform the operation defined by the `do` argument. It is useful for modifying the UI based on permissions, ensuring that functionalities a user does not have access to are not displayed.

```
function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
function can = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: current_user, do: 'admin_pages.view'
```

It can also accept additional `entity` and `access_callback` arguments, which allow you to [write your own authorization rules](#creating your-own-authorization-commands) cleanly.

##### `can_do_or_unauthorized` command

If the user does not have permission, the system renders a **403 Unauthorized** page, and the flow stops. Optionally, it accepts `redirect_anonymous_to_login` (boolean) parameter - if set to true, if the user is unauthenticated, instead of rendering 403, it will redirect the user to /sessions/new endpoint and upon login redirect back to `anonymous_return_to` parameter (defaults to current page - context.location.href). 

This command uses the deprecated `include` tag to work with the `break` Liquid tag properly - we do not want to execute code past this point if the user has no permission.

```
function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
# platformos-check-disable ConvertIncludeToRender, UnreachableCode
include 'modules/user/helpers/can_do_or_unauthorized', requester: current_user, do: 'users.register', redirect_anonymous_to_login: true
# platformos-check-enable ConvertIncludeToRender, UnreachableCode
```

The `platformos-check-disable` and `platformos-check-enable` tags are used to prevent the [platformOS-check](https://github.com/Platform-OS/platformos-check) from reporting a warning for using the `include` tag instead of the recommended `render` tag.

##### `can_do_or_redirect` command

If the user does not have permission, they will be redirected to the URL provided as an argument. This command uses the deprecated `include` tag to work with the `break` Liquid tag properly - we do not want to execute code past this point if the user has no permission.


```
function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
# platformos-check-disable ConvertIncludeToRender, UnreachableCode
include 'modules/user/helpers/can_do_or_redirect', requester: current_user, do: 'users.register', return_url: '/sessions/new'
# platformos-check-enable ConvertIncludeToRender, UnreachableCode
```

The `platformos-check-disable` and `platformos-check-enable` will let [platformos-check](https://github.com/Platform-OS/platformos-check) to not report a warning for using the `include` tag instead of the `render` tag.

###### Creating your own authorization commands

You can leverage existing commands while providing custom authorization rules by using the `access_callback` and `entity` arguments. Consider the following complex real-life example:

```
{% assign order = '{"buyer_id": 1, "seller_id": 2}' | parse_json %}
function can = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: user, do: 'orders.confirm', entity: order, access_callback: 'can/orders'
```

In this example, the `access_callback` is set to `can/orders`. We recommend placing all your authorization rules in one location: `app/lib/can`, naming the file after the relevant [Resource](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules#resourceful-route-naming-convention).

The `entity` represents the object for which you want to check if the requester has access. In this example, itâ€™s an eCommerce order.

The example implementation of the `app/lib/can/orders.liquid` might be as follows:

```
{% liquid
  assign order = entity

  if order == blank
    return false
  endif

  # For simplicity, there is a special `orders.manage.all` permission that allows the requester to do anything with orders.
  # Because it leverages the `can_do` helper, it will always return true for superadmins.
  function can_manage_all = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: requester, do: 'orders.manage.all'

  if can_manage_all
    return true
  endif

  # Check if the requester has a role that grants permission equal to `do`
  function can = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: requester, do: do

  if can
    case do
    when 'orders.confirm'
      if requester.id == order.seller_id
        return true
      endif
    when 'orders.buyer_cancel'
      if requester.id == order.buyer_id
        return true
      endif
    endcase
  endif

  return can
%}
```

The rules can be summarized as follows:
1. If the requester has access to the `orders.manage.all` permission, do not check granular permissions (like `orders.confirm` in the example), just grant access to all actions related to orders.
2. If the requester does not have `orders.manage.all`, check whether they have permission for the specific action represented by `do` ( like `orders.confirm` in the example).
3. If the requester has the `do` permission, check if they should have access to that particular order. Having the `orders.confirm` permission does not imply access to confirm all orders - sellers should only be able to confirm their own orders. In this example, the `seller_id` must match the `requester.id`. In more complex scenarios, you may need to perform additional GraphQL queries to enrich the `requester` or `order` data, ensuring accurate authorization.

#### Defining Roles' Permissions

Roles and their permissions are defined in the `modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid` file in a simple JSON format. You can modify this file to suit your applicationâ€™s requirements. For example, if you want to add a new role, such as **foo**, with permissions **foo.show** and **foo.manage**, you can extend the JSON as follows:

```
  "foo": [
    "foo.show",
    "site.manage"
  ]
```

If you receive a **500 error** after modifying the `permissions.liquid` file, check the logs for hints. The error might be due to an invalid JSON format, such as a missing or extra comma. For example, the following modification will raise an error due to a trailing comma:


```
  "foo": [
    "foo.show",
    "site.manage", <- this comma will cause an error
  ]
```

##### Conventions when adding permissions to your application

* * **Naming Convention for Permissions:** Use the format `<resource>.<do>` for naming your permissions. For example:
  - `article.create`
  - `article.edit`
  - `comment.delete`
* **Managing Permissions for Administrators/Moderators:** Use `<resource>.manage.all` for permissions granted to administrators or moderators. Regular users should typically have permission only for the entities they create. For example, in a blog application that allows users to write comments, users should be able to edit and delete their own comments.  In contrast, administrators and moderators need permission to manage all comments. We recommend creating a `<resource>.manage.all` permission for this purpose and handling it as described in the [Creating Your Own Authorization Commands](#creating-your-own-authorization-commands) example.

### Impersonation

This functionality allows a user with `users.impersonate` permission to log in as another user (unless they are superadmin - in which scenario `users.impersonate_superadmin` permission is needed). It comes with a dedicated logout process which logs the user back to their original profile.

### OAuth2

This feature allows users to authenticate using external identity providers such as Google, Facebook or GitHub.

#### Configuration
Configuring OAuth2 requires installing selected additional OAuth2 provider modules. Please follow the instructions provided by each installed module to configure it.

#### Custom OAuth2 provider

To implement a custom OAuth2 provider, you must provide two helper methods:

`get_redirect_url` - which generates a redirect URL to begin the OAUTH2 flow.

`get_user_info` - which returns a dictionary:

| Key | Value |
| - | - |
| sub | User's id in the external system |
| first_name | User's first name. |
| last_name | User's last name. |
| email | User's email. |
| valid | A boolean indicating whether the flow was successful or not. |

#### Endpoints for Loggin as another user

The table below contains the [resourceful routes](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/platformos-modules#resourceful-route-naming-convention) provided for the logging as functionality, ordered based on the flow. 

| HTTP method   | slug  | page file path |  description | partial rendering HTML |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST |  sessions/impersonations | `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/impersonation/create.liquid` |This feature allows an administrator to log in as another based on `user_id` parameter. Only users with the superadmin role can log in as another superadmin user. The original user ID is stored in the [session field](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#session) named `original_user_id` | |
| DESTROY | /sessions/impersonations | `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/impersonation/destroy.liquid`|Logging back in as the original user whose id was stored in `original_user_id` session field. | modules/community/public/views/partials/components/organisms/logging_back.liquid|

## Customizing the Module

You can easily customize the **User module** by [overwriting a module file](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/modules/modules#overwriting-a-module-file). This allows you to modify specific functionalities without changing the original code. Below are some common customization examples.

### Example 1: Changing the Sign-Up URL

By default, the module creates a [Page](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/pages) with the `/users/new` endpoint for the registration form. If you'd like to change it (e.g., to `/sign-up`), you can do so by overwriting this page and updating the `slug`.

Steps:
1. Create the necessary nested directories to be able to place your overwrite file there:

`mkdir -p app/modules/user/public/views/pages/users/`

2. Copy the original page file you would like to overwrite:

`cp modules/user/public/views/pages/users/new.liquid app/modules/user/public/views/pages/users/new.liquid`

3. Edit the overwrite file located in `app/modules/user/public/views/pages/users/new.liquid`. Modify the YAML section of the page to change the `slug`. (Make sure you are modifying the overwrite and not the original fileâ€”overwrites are located in the `<project root>/app/modules` directory, whereas the original files are located in the `<project root>/modules` directory.)

4. Modify the Liquid code - explicitly define `slug` property to `sign-up` of the `app/modules/user/public/views/pages/users/new.liquid` [Page](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/pages) to define `/sign-up` endpoint:

```yaml
---
slug: sign-up
---
```
```liquid
{% raw %}
{% liquid
  function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
  include 'modules/user/helpers/can_do_or_unauthorized', requester: current_user, do: 'users.register'

  function registration_fields = 'modules/user/queries/registration_fields/load'
  theme_render_rc 'modules/user/users/new', context: context, registration_fields: registration_fields
%}
{% endraw %}
```

As a result, the registration form will now be available at `/sign-up`, and the `/users/new` URL will render a 404 Not Found error.

### Example 2: Modifying the HTML of the Sign-In Form
If you want to modify the **Sign-In** form's HTML, you can overwrite the [Partial](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/reusing-code-across-multiple-pages) responsible for rendering the form.
If you want to modify the **Sign-In** form's HTML, you can overwrite the [Partial](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/reusing-code-across-multiple-pages) responsible for rendering the form.

Steps:
1. Create the directory for the overwrite. Since we are overriding the presentation layer, we should overwrite the [Partial](https://documentation.platformos.com/developer-guide/pages/reusing-code-across-multiple-pages).

`mkdir -p modules/user/public/views/partials/sessions`

2. Copy the partial responsible for rendering the sign-in form:

`cp modules/user/public/views/partials/sessions/new.liquid app/modules/user/public/views/partials/sessions/new.liquid`
> [!NOTE] 
> Please note that in this example, we are working with the `sessions` directory, as this is where the Sign-In functionality is located.
Now, you can freely modify the HTML or presentation layer of the sign-in form in the copied file.
> [!NOTE] 
> Please note that in this example, we are working with the `sessions` directory, as this is where the Sign-In functionality is located.
## Helper Queries and Commands

The module also provides several useful queries and commands to help you manage users and permissions

### Query: Count All Users

```
function users_count = 'modules/user/queries/user/count'
```

### Query: Get Currently Authenticated User

```
function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
```

### Query: Get Information About User Based on ID

```
function current_user = 'modules/user/queries/user/load', id: 1
```

## Versioning

To manage versioning with Git and npm, you can follow these commands:

```
git fetch origin --tags
npm version major | minor | patch
```
